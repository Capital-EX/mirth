# Mirth - a type-safe functional Forth.

Mirth is a language in the Forth family, with a focus on type-safety, functional programming, and low-level control. Mirth will have dependent types, linear types, elaborator macros, and much more.

This repository contains:

- the Mirth compiler (eventually, in the folder `mirth`)
- the bootstrap interpreter for Mirth (eventually, in the folder `bootstrap`)
- tests for the bootstrap and compiler (eventually, in the folder `tests`)
- documentation for the language (eventually, in the folder `docs`)
- the Mirth package `base` which includes the `Prelude` (in the folder `base`)
- examples of Mirth (in the folder `examples`)
- informal models of Mirth (in the folder `formal`)

Mirth is still very much a work in progress. Please support the development of Mirth on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mirth_lang)!
